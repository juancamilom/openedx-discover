A learner simply inputs a question and clicks the Submit button. ChatGPT will then analyze the question and provide a response based on its understanding of the topic, and as it’s powered by AI it can provide answers to a wide range of questions, from simple queries to complex problems. One of the key benefits of the ChatGPT XBlock is that it can be trained to focus only on the course subject. In other words, ChatGPT will only answer questions related to the course topic, ensuring that students receive accurate and relevant information. The component can be inserted multiple times across the course in different units, with each component being provided a unique context so that it provides answers in said context.\n\n## Links\n- **Product**: , docs_link:",

Specifically, learners can use this component to identify what they already know about the course content, as well as what they are curious to learn. Once the course is completed, learners can revisit their initial thoughts and assess what they actually learned. They can then move each point into a third category called Learned which showcases the knowledge they gained through the course.\n\n## Links\n- **Docs**: https://github.com/edly-io/kwl-xblock\n- **Product**: https://github.com/edly-io/kwl-xblock",
